## Introduction
---
### Objectives
After this module you should be able to:
* Explain why learn JavaScript
* Describe what JavaScript can do and cannot do
* Describe the history of JavaScript
* Use JavaScript in a web page
* Explain graceful degradation and progressive
  enhancement
* Describe the tools needed for the course
* Test JavaScript in browser console
---
### Why JavaScript?
* Programming Language of the Web, one of the
  most popular and in demand language:
  * [10 Best Progamming Languages to Learn in 2024](https://www.guru99.com/best-programming-language.html)
  * [Most used programming lanugages](https://www.statista.com/statistics/793628/worldwide-developer-survey-most-used-languages/)
  * [Client-side ue of JavaScript](ttps://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cp-javascript/all/all)
* It can enhance / enrich your website significantly,
  and much more.
---
### History 
* May 1995: Created by Brendan Eich at Netscape (now Mozilla)
* Nov 1996: Netscape submitted JavaScript to European
* Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA)
* June 1997: ECMAScript 1
* ...
---
### History
* 2009: ECMAScript 5
* 2015: ECMAScript 6
* Since 2015, every year there has been a new update. The
  newest version is: ECMAScript 14 released in June 2023
* [ECMAScript 2023 standard](https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/)
* [ECMAScript version history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript_version_history)
---
### What can JS do?
* JavaScript's applications are continually growing.
* It has traditionally worked with front-end of
  websites, i.e., client scripting.
* It has extended to server-side applications.
* It can also program standalone applications and
  mobile applications.
---
### What can JS do?
On the client side its use can be categorized into two
types, 1) enhancing the web page and 2) providing
essential functionality that the web page can't do
without.
* JavaScript can make websites more interactive,
  interesting, and user-friendly.
* JavaScript lets you access and modify the content
  and markup of web pages as the user is viewing
  them.
---
### What can JS do?
Here are just a few typical examples of its use on a
website
* Special effects and animations, https://adoratorio.studio/
* Slideshows (carousel), http://wowslider.com/
* Dropdown Menus
* Form validation
---
### What can JS do?
* Personalization of a website
* Ajax, etc.
* https://www.grandcircus.co/blog/10-things-you-can-build-with-javascript/
---
### What JS cannot do
* It cannot directly access files on the server without
  additional help
* It cannot directly access files on the client machine
* It cannot access web pages hosted on another
  domain
* JavaScript cannot protect your page source or
  images.

### Best Use of JavaScript
![best use of JavaScript](best-use.png)
---
### Best Use of JavaScript
* Use JavaScript to add features and enhance
  user experience that html and CSS cannot do.
* There are many uses of JavaScript on a
  website.
* Some examples are listed on the next slides
---
### Best Use of JavaScript
* Handling use interactionsâ€”mouse/touch and
  keyboard events.
* Allowing rich UI features such as accordions, tabs,
  and sliders (carousel).
* Validating and processing user input on the client
  side.
---
### Best Use of JavaScript
* Producing complex animation & web games.
* Updating page content without reloading the
  whole page using AJAX.
* Supporting server-side functions.
---
### Enahancement and Degradation 
* Progressive enhancement and graceful
  degradation are two commonly used web design
  strategies.
* Graceful Degradation: building a website that 
  works best in a modern
  browser that uses JavaScript, but still works to a
  reasonable standard in older browsers, or if
  JavaScript or some of its features are
  unavailable.
---
### Enahancement and Degradation 
* Progressive Enhancement:
  building a web page from the ground up with a base
  level of functionality, then adding extra
  enhancements if they are available in the browser.
---
### Enahancement and Degradation 
* When adding JS code to your webpage, need to
  keep in mind which strategy to take.
* Clearly separating the website into 3 layers serves
  both strategies well.
* https://www.w3.org/wiki/Graceful_degradation_versus_progressive_enhancement
---
### Enahancement and Degradation 
* The `<noscript>` tag is commonly used to detect if JS
  is enabled in the browser, so that you can present
  the features to the user accordingly.
```html
  <noscript>
    html code if JS is not supported
  </noscript>
```
* [Example](/demos/week-01-noscript/)
---
### Disabling JS in Firefox
1. Open a new tab 
1. Type `about:config` in the address bar 
1. Accept the risk ðŸ˜¬ and continue
1. Type `javascript.enabled` in the search box
1. Click the toggle next to `javascript.enabled`
1. Return to your original tab and refresh
1. Toggle back when you are done testing
---
### Disabling JS in Chrome
1. Go to Menu > Settings > Privacy & Security > Site Settings > Content > JavaScript 
1. Select the option "Don't allow sites to use JavaScript"
1. Return to your orginal tab and refresh
1. Select "Sites can use JavaScript" when you are done testing
---
### DOM and BOM Basics
* The figure on the next slide shows the Browser
  Object Model (BOM) Structure.
* `window` is the object representing the
  browser window, which has many
  child objects.
* `document` represents the current html
  document in the browser window. A
  Document Object Model (DOM) is a
  conceptual way of visualizing a
  document and its contents, which will
  be discussed further later in the
  course.
---
### DOM and BOM Basics
![BOM](bom.png)
---
### DOM and BOM Basics
* Each object has certain properties and methods. To
  access them, dot . notation is used.
```javascript
window.alert('hi, there!');
window.document.write('welcome to the page!');
```
---
### DOM and BOM Basics
* Since there is only one window object in the
  environment, it can be omitted. The following
  statement produces the same result as the previous
  ones.
```javascript
alert('hi, there!');
document.write('welcome to the page!');
```
---
## Adding JavaScript to a Web Page 
---
### Adding JS Code to a Page 
* You use the `&lt;script&gt;` tag to add JavaScript code to a
  webpage.
* You can just add JavaScript code between the
  opening and closing script tags.
* Script tag can appear anywhere in the page.
* Common places are
  * the head section
  * right above `&lt;/body&gt;`, and
  * the location where JS code is needed
---
### Adding JS Code to a Page 
* JavaScript runs where it is in the html
  doc.
* When the browser encounters a
  `&lt;script&gt;` element it:
  * Stops other activities to load the script.
  * Runs the JS code.
---
### Simple JS Statements
* Write html or text in place
```javascript
document.write('some text here');
```
* The string may include html markup
* Show a popup message
```javascript
alert('Hi!');
```
* Prompt the user for input:
```javascript
let input = prompt('Proceed?');
```
* `input` is a variable to store the user input.

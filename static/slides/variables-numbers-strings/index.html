## Variables, Numbers and Strings
---
### Objectives
* Using variables
* write JS code using the numeric types.
* convert between number types.
* Working with operators
* use Boolean data types.
* explain the meaning of null and undefined
---
### Objectives
* define and use strings.
* use escape sequences.
* manipulate strings using string methods.
* use template strings.
---
## Statements and Comments
---
### Statement
* Each individual instruction in a script is called a
  statement.
* Each statement should end with a semi-colon ;
```javascript
document.write('Welcome!') ;
```
---
### Comment 
* You use **comments** to explain what your code
  does.
* They help yourself remember it and help others
  understand it.
```javascript
// single line comment
/* multiple line comment. 
     Text here
     is ignored by 
     JS Interpreter. */
```
---
### Reserved Words 
* Reserved words have predefined meanings in
  JavaScript.
* Cannot be used to name variables and the like
  such as function parameters and object
  properties.
* NOTE - JavaScript is a case sensitive language.
  Name and name are different.
---
### Reserved Words 
```text
break case catch class const continue debugger default 
delete do else export extends false finally for function 
if import in instanceof new null return super switch 
this throw true try typeof var void while with let static
yield await enum implements interface package private 
protected public abstract boolean byte char double final 
float goto int long native short synchronized throws 
transient volatile arguments as async eval from get of set
```
---
## Variables
---
### Variables 
* Scripts often need to store data temporarily in
  order to complete certain tasks.
* A variable is just a named storage space. Data is
  stored in variables.
* A variable should be declared before you use it:
```javascript
var quantity; //prior ES6
let price;    //variable
const ratio;  //constant
```
---
### Variables
* `let` and `const` are new to ES6 and are better
  options than `var`. So, use `let` or `const` instead of
  `var`.
* When declaring a variable, no data type is
  specified.
* The data type of a variable is determined by the
  value it's assigned.
---
### Variable Declaration 
* By default, JavaScript doesn't require variable
  declaration before use.
* However, it's a good practice to declare all variables
  before use.
* To enforce that, add "use strict" at the beginning of
  each js file.
```javascript 
'use strict';
```
---
### Strict Mode
* strict mode has other features
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1335851/what-does-use-strict-do-in-javascript-and-what-is-the-reasoning-behind-it
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode
---
### Constant and Variable Naming
* A JS constant / variable name can start with any
  upper- or lower-case letter, an underscore, `_`, or
  dollar character, `$`.
* A variable name may contain digits but not start
  with a digit.
* NOTE - use `_` and `$` with caution, as `_` commonly
  means a private variable and `$` is used by jQuery
---
### Constant and Variable Naming 
```javascript
let   product;        // ok
const _ratio;         // ok
let   $name = 'John'; // ok 
let   price1;         // ok
let   1price;         // NOT ok
```
---
## Data Types and operators
---
### Data Types
* string: `'product name'`
* number: `3.5`
* bigint for integer numbers of arbitrary length.
* boolean: `true` / `false`
* undefined
* null
* symbol (new to ES6), and
* object
---
### Data Types
* When you declare a variable, no data type is
  required.
* Same value could be interpreted as different
  types under different context.
* `typeof` operator is used to check a value's type
```javascript
typeof 3.5
```
---
### Data Types
![typeof](typeof.png)
---
### Numerical Values
* In addition to integers and floating-point values,
  JS also supports hexadecimal (16 based), binary,
  and octal (8 based) numbers using the following
  prefix (the first char is zero, the 2nd is a letter)
* `0x` hexadecimal, e.g., `let x = 0xff;`
* `0b` binary, e.g., `let x = 0b111;`
* `0o` octal, e.g., `let x = 0o777;` some browsers may allow you
  to save the 2nd char o.
---
### Primitive Values with Methods 
* A method is an operation / function that can be
  applied to an object.
* Different from other languages, JavaScript allows
  primitive values to use methods.
* e.g. `.toFixed(n)` converts a number to a string with 
  a fixed number of decimal places
```javascript
let w = 2.22, h = 4.33;
let area = w * h;       // 9.6126
area = area.toFixed(2); // '9.61'
(9.6126).toFixed(2);    // also works
```
---
### Arithmetic Operators
* All regular arithmetic operations are supported by
  JavaScript: `+ - * /`
* `**`: exponentiation (new to ES201)
* `++`: increment
* `--`: decrement
* `%`: modulo (remainder)

```javascript
let x = 2; x = x ** 3;     // x has the value 8 now
let x = 5; x++;            // x has the value 6 now
let x = 5; x--;            // x has the value 4 now
let x = 10; let y = x % 3; // y has value 1
```
---
### Compound Assignment Operators
* You can combine an arithmetic operator and the
  assignment operator to achieve the compound
  effect.
```javascript
let x = 2, y =3;
x += y;  // x has 5 now
x -= 2;  // x has 3 now
x *= 3;  // x has 9 now
x /= 2;  // x has 4.5 now
y **= 2; // y has 9 now
```
---
### Modulo Operator 
* `%` modulo operation is typically applied to
  integers. The result is the remainder of a
  division operation.
* When negative values involved, the result goes
  with the sign of the dividend (the left operand).
* You may also apply `%` to floating point values. In
  that case, both values will be treated as integers.
```javascript
let x = 5.0 % 2.0; // x has 1
let y = 5.5 % 2.0; // y has 1.5
```
---
### Type Coercion 
* If operands in an operation are different types,
  JavaScript will try to convert one operand to an
  equivalent value of the other operand's type, such
  as in: `'2' * 5`
* Don't depend on type coercion as it may create
  confusion, e.g., `'2' + 5`
---
### Boolean Type
* Boolean type data can have one of the two values
  - `true` or `false`
* JavaScript interprets any nonzero numerical value
  as `true` and zero as `false`. All following values are
  also false:
  * `false`
  * `undefined`
  * `null`
  * `0` (zero)
  * `NaN`
  * `''` (empty string)
---
### null vs. undefined
* `null` represents a valid but nonexistent value. For
  example, `getElementById()` returns `null` if there is
  no element returned. It's equivalent to `0` for a
  numerical value and `false` for a Boolean value.
* The `undefined` value indicates that a variable has
  been declared but not been assigned a value.
* `null`, `undefined`, and `''` are all considered `false`
  when evaluated to a logical value. Other than that,
  they are not the same at all.
---
### Number Object and Methods
* `Number` object can be used to check and convert a
  numerical value.
* `Number.isNaN(value)` - `NaN`: Not a Number; an
  undefined value or value that cannot be represented,
  especially results of floating-point calculations.
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/NaN
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/NaN
---
### Number Object and Methods
```javascript
Number.isNaN(0 / 0);    // true; 0/0 is undefined
Number.isNaN(5/0);      // false; 5/0 is infinity
Number.isNaN(3 * 'hi'); // true
Number.isNaN('abc');    // false; a string doesn't fit the
                        // definition.
```
---
### Number Object and Methods
* `Number.isInteger(value)`
* `Number.isFinite(value)`
* `Number('digitString')` - converts the digit string to a
  numerical value or returns NaN if not convertible.
---
### Number Object and Methods
```javascript  
Number.isInteger(123);   // true
Number.isInteger('123'); // false
Number.isFinite(10);     // true
Number.isFinite(10/0);   // false
Number('10')             // 10
Number('10am')           // NaN
```
---
### Number Object and Methods
* `Number.parseFloat(str)` and
  `Number.parseInt(str)` convert the string to a
  numerical value.
* The difference between these two methods and
  `Number()` is: if the string starts with a digit, these
  two methods will extract the numerical portion
  until the first non-digit character
---
### Number Object and Methods
```javascript
Number.parseInt('10px');     //returns 10
Number.parseInt('10.5em');   // returns 10
Number.parseFloat('10.5em'); // returns 10.5
Number('10.5em');            // returns NaN  
```
---
### Number Object and Methods
* Some methods mentioned are also global, i.e.,
  they can be used without any object involved
  (`window` is the implicit object).
* Adding these methods to the `Number` object is new to
  ES6 and it is generally preferred to use them
  instead of the global ones.
* NOTE - occasionally, the global and `Number`
  methods such as `isNaN()`, produce inconsistent
  results
---
## Characters and Strings
---
### Strings
* String is a primitive type in JavaScript.
* You can assign a string literal to a variable or use
  `String` constructor to make a new string object.
Examples
There are differences between these two methods.
The first method is generally preferred.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17256182/what-is-the-difference-between-string-primitives-and-string-objects-in-javascrip
---
### Strings
```javascript
let str1 = 'Hello';
let str2 = new String('Hello'); //constructor is
                                // used
```
---
### Strings
* Use back slash `\` to escape a char in a string.
  Escaping means making a regular char after `\`
  special and making a special char after `\` literal.
---
### Concatenating Strings 
* The `+` operator is used to join strings.
```javascript
let greeting = 'Hello ';
let name = 'Bob';
let message = greeting + name;
```
* A string can be expanded like this
```javascript
message = message + "! It's a great day!";
```
* `concat()` method can do the same job but `+`
  and `+=` are recommended.
---
### Using String Methods 
* `.indexOf(subStr, n)` Returns the index of the first subStr in the string starting with index n
* `.lastIndexOf(subStr, n)` Return the index of the last subStr in the string where index <= n
* `.repeat(n)` Returns a new string with n copies of the string
* `.replace(str1, str2)` Replaces str1 with str2 in the string
---
### Using String Methods 
* `.split('delimiter')` Splits the string into an array of substrings, and returns the new array
* `.substr(i, n)` Extracts a substring of n chars from the string, starting from index I
* `.toLowerCase()` Converts all letters in the string to lowercase letters
* `.toUpperCase()` Converts all letters in the string to uppercase letters
---
### Template Strings
* We used `+` or `concat()` to build strings when
  variables are involved, which could be tedious and
  error prone.
* Template string encloses its content using
  backticks \` , the key under esc on your keyboard,
  not the standard apostrophe.
* Template string extracts variable values enclosed in
  it with the format of `${variable}`.
* You can use standard quotation marks in a
  template string without escaping them.
---
### Template Strings
* Template string can also embed an expression in
  the string, i.e., `${expression}`.
```javascript
let total = 10;
let tax = 1.2;
msg = `The total is $${total + tax} ($${total} + $${tax} tax).`;
alert(msg); // 'The total is $11.2 ($10 + $1.2 tax)'
```
---
### Summary 
* Writing JavaScript statements
* Using variables and constants
* Working with different data types - such as
* numerical, Boolean, characters and strings
* Working with operators
